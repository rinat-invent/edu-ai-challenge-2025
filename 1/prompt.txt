You are tasked with selecting the most suitable database for a new social platform application. The application has the following requirements:

- It is a social platform with millions of users.
- It needs to store user profiles, posts, and connections (relationships) between users.
- High data read speed is required.
- The expected operation split is 80% read operations and 20% write operations.
- Scalability is important as the user base is expected to grow.

Your task is to analyze these requirements and justify the selection of the most appropriate type of database for this project. Use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to break down your analysis into clear, logical steps. Ensure that your reasoning addresses each requirement and explains how the chosen database type meets those needs. Provide a step-by-step explanation of your thought process, leading to a final database selection.

Remember to consider different database types (e.g., relational, NoSQL document, NoSQL key-value, NoSQL column-family, graph, multi-model) and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses in the context of the given requirements.

End your response with a clear statement of the selected database type.
