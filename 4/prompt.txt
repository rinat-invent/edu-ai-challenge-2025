You are tasked with conducting a comprehensive code review of the following Java method using role prompting. Please analyze the provided code from three distinct expert perspectives, providing specific and actionable feedback for each role.
Code to Review:
javaimport java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public List<Map<String, Object>> processUserData(List<Map<String, Object>> data) {
    List<Map<String, Object>> users = new ArrayList<>();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < data.size(); i++) {
        Map<String, Object> user = new HashMap<>();
        user.put("id", data.get(i).get("id"));
        user.put("name", data.get(i).get("name"));
        user.put("email", data.get(i).get("email"));
        user.put("active", data.get(i).get("status").equals("active") ? true : false);
        users.add(user);
    }
    
    System.out.println("Processed " + users.size() + " users");
    
    return users;
}

public boolean saveToDatabase(List<Map<String, Object>> users) {
    // TODO: Implement database connection
    boolean success = true;
    return success;
}
